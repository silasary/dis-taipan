50% [Dis-Snek](https://github.com/Discord-Snake-Pit/Dis-Snek) features that are either too undercooked for merging into the library proper
50%  "application specific" common code I want to use in most of my bots, but don't fit the philosophy of dis-snek itself.

A taipan is a dangerous australian snake.  I thought it was mildly amusing.

```
pip install dis-taipan
